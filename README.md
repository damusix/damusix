# Hello, World!

I'm a "big picture" thinker that likes to go into the minutiae. I focus on building things that work well, are consistent, and can stay afloat throughout the years. I love history, not only because it's interesting, but because it's the lens through which to understand the present day.

I also very much like philosophy. While everyone else is chasing the latest JavaScript trends, I'm over here [applying 2,400-year-old principles of logic](https://alonso.network/aristotelian-logic-as-the-foundation-of-code/) to modern software problems. I very-much think Aristotle would've been a 20x programmer.

## What I Actually Do

I like to think of myself as a **first principles engineer** who thinks through problems from the ground up. I validate inputs before processing them, name variables for what they actually contain, and write code that's maintainable five years from now.

> "Full stack developer" ??

Yeah, I guess. I've never understood the term too much since, to me, every technologist should be able to stand up their own work.

I do the "full" stack:
- **Backend**: APIs in any language, any framework. I understand it fundamentally (HTTP spec, server-client interactions, etc)
- **Frontend**: UIs built from the foundation (DOM) outward (React, if you insist)
- **Database**: Schemas that make sense over time. Facts don't change in five years— businesses do.
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines that are simple, yet powerful. Grindy work should be automated—it provides little value not to.
- **AI**: AI-first is the new "mobile-first". Agentic workflows, chatbots, and all of the new bedazzle.

## Public Works

**Libraries that solve real problems in the TS realm:**
- [logosdx/monorepo](https://github.com/logosdx/monorepo) - Collection of utilities built on necessity and a weariness of repetition. I use this to build cross-platform apps, ETLs, and resiliency.

**Fun stuff:**
- [BJJ Timer](https://bjj-timer.pages.dev/) - Martial arts needs proper timing
- [CV Generator](https://github.com/damusix/cv.alonso.network) - Since I'm too lazy to use Google Docs / MS Word

**Open source contributions:**
- [hapi.dev](https://hapi.dev) - Stable server framework that doesn't change every other month.
- [hapipal.com](https://hapipal.com) - Hapi ecosystem tools

## Skills That Pay The Bills

* **Languages & Frameworks:** TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Bash, Elixir, Ruby, PHP
* **Databases:** TSQL (MSSQL), open source SQL (PG, Mysql, SQLite, DuckDB, etc), MongoDB, Redis
* **Infrastructure:** Terraform/Pulumi, Docker/Swarm, AWS, Practical Linux Sysadmin
* **AI/ML:** Agentic Workflows, Chatbots, Instructor, HuggingFace, Foundation Model APIs, etc
